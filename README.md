# Use of AI to implement better exhibition itineraries and avoid crowds
My AI Idea for the final task of Building AI course
This is a poster for a future project! Feel free to comment and add suggestions :)

## Summary

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can be used in museums and art galleries to analyze data from visitors in order to optimize exhibition itineraries, creating better user experiences and avoid crowds in the hotspots of the exhibitions.


## Background

In the first steps of the reopening of museums after the pandemic, it is vital to organize itineraries that can assure the satisfaction of the safety's requirements.

Particularly for small museums, the currently used ways to avoid crowds is to allows a limited number of visitors, thus leading to monetary losses.

The idea is to use AI for a better understanding on how the flow of people inside museums move, and identify the spots in which the majority of visitors gather for a bigger timeframe: this would allow to optimize the amount of visitors inside museums at the same time. 

## How is it used?

The implemented solution would allow to analyze data from questionnaires given to visitors at the end of the exhibition, and cameras that, in respect of the privacy, counts the number of people in specific rooms.
Knowing if a strong percentage of visitors prefers to follow a straight path or wandering around can help in the set-up stage of the museum's collections, and it can be useful also to plan two or three different ways of visiting the exhibitions, according to visitor's preferences.


## Challenges

The challeng of this project is that it's necessary to collect a sufficient amount of data before applying the solution. It is also important to take into account that museum visitors are a wide target, therefore tracking informations and analyzing them in a correct way can be difficult. 

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
The project could grow by using the solution mainly to customize the visitor's experience inside museums, allowing them to personalize each visit according to their interests.
